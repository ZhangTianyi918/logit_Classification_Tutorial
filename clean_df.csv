They will be allowed to burn person after person out. And that's just okay.

Company does a good job communicating from top level to all employees.","The job can be quite monotonous and boring. I've been in the position about 1.5 yrs and before I accepted the job and from the interviews I got the vibe that the skills I would learn would be more relevant but the job sounded super boring and the interviewers sounded tired. After going through the experience I can say my first 6 months I was pretty excited to be working here, but it's gotten worse each half year. Mainly the projects take a really long time, either to get going or to wrap up. There's always a reason for delaying it getting going, so a ton of time is spent on preparation but we don't ever seem to be confident that everything will go 100% smooth because it inevitably never will. Then the projects that need to be wrapped up either take longer than expected because people don't know what to do well enough, or it hasn't ever been encountered in exactly the way we are now, those are sort of unavoidable but what is avoidable is getting everyone to agree that the solution we came up with is good enough and meets the targets we set so that we can close the ticket, get off the ship and work on the next thing. That really needs improving. Also, the most obvious thing is we have too many meetings. I mean if you google how many meetings people should have in a day, the recommendation is 3-4 but the minimum is 4 and can go up from there, really 5 if you want to be involved in everything, and that's just being present where you need to be. You could certainly spend your entire day just attending meetings and that would not be very productive.","1","Advanced Micro Device"

Below are some of the Cons which might help you while choosing your next destination. 1. There is no work-life balance at all. In the motive of beating every competitor out there, AMD is actually killing its employees. Our manager clearly says, there is no work life balance here, there is no option but to work for more than 10-12 hours to complete the work. But in reality, you end up working for 15-16 hours. 2. There is status meeting almost every other day. Tracking is done to very minute level 3. Micromanagement is prevalent 4. They have releases almost every month but time given is so short that one cannot deep dive to its fullest as task needs to be completed soon 5. Their appraisal cycle is worst of anything. Their appraisal period is from Jan to Dec, but the hike is effective from July next year. 6. Due to this, many employees in our team and others are speculating to leave once situation outside settles 7. Because there was uncertainty in market, AMD CEO deducted 20% of yearly bonus from every employee. And few days later, she was entitles a bonus of ~1 Million USD. Hypocrisy. 8. The reason AMD was in top 100 best companies to work is because their share price has increased dramatically and this has benefitted employees. 9. This is the company which doesn't give basic facility like internet bill compensation, office cabs or even proper food in their pantry, though they are making money because of the hardwork of employees.","0","Advanced Micro Device"

But everyone will ask for status updates day and night.\r\n\r\nInstead of actual work, most of the focus is on meetings. You will spend half of your working hours in meetings and giving status. Therefore making it obvious that you need to spend extra hours to complete the actual work.\r\n\r\nThere are lot of VLSI companies having much better work culture than AMD. Join them and save your career.\r\n\r\nOnce you join AMD, there won't be any increments and bonuses given to you for more than a year.\r\n\r\nSave your personal life and your career. Stay away from AMD.","0","Advanced Micro Device"

Note that this does not mean your efforts will be appreciated or that you will advance in your career faster. Some senior employees even work through vacation days.\n2. Management does not care about employees. Constantly looking to make employees work through weekends, christmas break etc. with no additional pay or days back in lieu. Middle management blames senior management by saying these are requests cascaded from the top. \n3. Pay is the lowest in the industry. Competition (Intel\u002FNVIDIA) pays significantly higher.

These recharge days come directly out of your vacation days. Sometimes a recharge day might fall on a friday which you take off and burn a vacation day, and then you might be expected to come in on the saturday to work. You do not get any additional pay or a day off in lieu for coming on a saturday. \n5. You'll notice that a lot of junior employees\u002Fnew grads have lead positions. This is management trying to squeeze as much juice as possible while paying the lowest possible salaries.\n6. Some teams can be cliquey. Some managers fraternize with some direct reports ( hanging out constantly outside of work ) which is completely unprofessional and leads to favouritism. If you're not part of this inner circle, you get passed over for promotions or higher raises. \n7. Female CEO but women face constant sexism. Women coming back from maternity leave lose their progress in advancing to the next level. Women taking their full maternity leave entitlement get shamed\u002Ftalked about behind their back (as if maternity leave is a vacation).

"1363",2555,2011-05-14 00:33:40,FALSE,938115,5,3,0,0,2,3,3,"AMD Markham had an amazing assortment of technical talent in all positions. All engineers I found myself interacting with were extremely competent, and for the most part, quite friendly. My co-workers were usually happy to answer any questions I had regarding their area of expertise. As a result I received some very good advice in regard to design methodology, which was not properly covered during my University education.\r\n\r\nIndividual teams were all focused and dedicated to their tasks. There was seldom any confusion regarding the purpose of a team, or the results that were expected of them. Intra-team politics were generally quite low key, and  were seldom more serious than personality conflicts among incompatible team members. Fortunately management was able to contain even those such that team productivity did not suffer.\r\n\r\nI also very much enjoyed the large amount of personal freedom given to employees. Work hours were not very strict, and the engineers were free to come and go as needed; it was not uncommon to see and impromptu tech discussions develop over coffee. Management would generally adopt a hands-off approach, only micro-managing during crunch times, which were thankfully quite short. Team-wide meetings were also a very positive and friendly experience for everyone involved.","Unfortunately, AMD is quite old for a tech company, and it shows. To make matters worse, the AMD and ATI merger was not nearly as smooth as it could have been, resulting in a lot of conflicting processes and incompatible data organization styles. Also, while most technical personnel were very reasonable and professional, there were some people in very high positions that let the seniority really go to their head.\r\n\r\nAMD has been operational for over 40 years, while ATI has been going for 25 years, only 5 of which were as part of AMD. During this time both of these companies saw momentous shifts in technology, and in many cases were right at the center of these shifts. Over such a long time a lot of processes are developed to address a huge range of problems that inevitably arise during operation. Unfortunately, being on the leading wave of technology means that most of these processes could not take advantage of the innovations they help to implement. \r\n\r\nOnce a company of this size defines a number of new processes, standard corporate mentality takes over and the short-term cost of optimizing these processes becomes very difficult to justify on the balance sheets. The result is that these decisions can easily live on for decades, until replacing them becomes an emergency concern, with all of the associated headaches, rushed specifications, and buggy implementations. Of course the existence of competing standards defined within the scope of ATI before it was acquired effectively doubles the number of stakeholders, and makes the problem not only more challenging, but also more pressing.\r\n\r\nAlso as a result of the age of these companies, relevant information is extremely hard to find. The company wide search is about as advanced as a search engine of the mid 1990s, and will only respond to some very creative search term voodoo. Often times the only way to get some information is to ask someone familiar with the topic where to find the data you are looking for. This is not a difficult task when you can ask a team member, but becomes exponentially harder the further away you have to look. \r\n\r\nFinally, while most personnel, both technical and management, are very helpful and professional, there are a few people in senior positions that are quite the opposite. Over the years, certain people have managed to take control of very large and important projects, and now make working in these project domains extremely difficult. Often these situations are a result of personal or cultural problems, but the resulting political dancing necessary to fix even the smallest issue is daunting for an engineer without a political background; this includes most of those on a non-management track.","0","Advanced Micro Device"

Since this company is based in the midwest- you generally work with wholesome nice \""salt of the earth \""people. Outside of sales, they aren't cut throat and try to take care of their people.\n*COVID Response- the company had all of the employees that could work remotely work remotely, we have a configuration center that was an essential operation, if there were any issues, they had the whole center professionally sanitized to keep the config center workers safe. Our health and safety has always been #1. Unlike other companies, CDW hasn't rushed us back into the office- they have being taking surveys, seeing what people are comfortable with and are cautiously going forward. I'm glad they aren't pushing people to get back into the office ASAP- they been very understanding and been very respectful of employees privacy and wishes. \n* Fertility Benefits just got upgraded BIG time- CDW in 2021 has partnered with Progyny for fertility benefits. You can get 3-4 cycles of IVF, Egg Transfer, along genetic testing covered. This is offered to all employees including LBTQ+ couples and single people who want to start a family on their own. Also they will pay for 3-4 rounds of Elective Egg Freezing which is outstanding if you are an unpartnered female. Having friends who are in deep debt because of lack of IVF coverage with their work, this is huge if you are looking at starting a family.\n* A company will never be your family and I dislike when companies compare themselves to that. That being said, CDW is the company that has gotten me closest to that \""feeling\"". Everyone here is really nice and I feel very supported here. Other companies I feel like I could get fired at any moment and not know why or because I wasn't part of the \""in crowd\"". Outside of sales (they are performance based), if there is an issue, they will have you work with your manager to level set expectations and try to met those goals. There's no surprises when it comes to my performance and I feel much more secure here than any other job I have had.\n*Annual Increase- If you have a good rating, CDW usually does a merit increase each year. This is amazing because at least your salary increases each year \n which helps a lot with inflation. Not many companies do this at all and every year you have to \""fight\"" for more money. I'm so glad I don't have to do this anymore and can get a merit increase for being great at my job. When my rent goes higher I don't freak out as my merit increase will cover it and I can maintain my lifestyle.","* Too many, tools process and admin work- 60-70% my job is dealing with discrepancies, pushing orders through, making exceptions etc. CDW makes it work but processes are very complex and it takes years to learn all the nuances of everything. I'm still not sure how everything exactly works and I can thankfully lean on others to help me if I don't know something.\n* CDW needs to work in it's diversity. They done an awesome job of promoting white women into their senior leadership and C-suite roles. They need to start promoting people of color and women of color into management and senior leadership positions- that *aren't* D&amp;I\u002FHR roles. I will say as a person of color- this is the most supportive and comfortable working environment I've been.

This experience is invaluable in understanding the interconnectivity of the departments, and how they can be leveraged to differentiate your brand or product.\r\n\r\nOverall employees vested in your success and the success of the company. A lot of people really love CDW and that feeling can be contagious. There are a lot of company outings and activities (pre-COVID) with many genuine friendships developed over time.\r\n\r\nThere are many education and training opportunities. Partnerships with colleges such as CLC and DePaul enabled several employees to earn advanced degrees. Lean Six Sigma trainings occur regularly. Linkedin Learning encouragement. Most anyone is willing to help you pick up a new skill so if you don't have a ton of experience you can get it pretty quickly.\r\n\r\nWhen the company says family first they do mean it. I never had an issue leaving for a doctor appointment, injured dog, or working from home last minute because kids were sick. Much of the PPM team has kids so there is a mutual understanding and respect for this. If you have young kids this is a really good department to be in.\r\n\r\nYou will work with some of the top technology brands in the world. By understanding how those organizations work and interact with different channels you get a better understanding of the industry in aggregate and not just where CDW plays.\r\n\r\nRecent leadership changes in the department bode well for the future. They are hiring strategic leaders with the necessary experience to make meaningful change to better leverage resources.","Pay is significantly below other types of positions in the IT industry (At least 25% less). It is repeatedly highlighted in company surveys and the line is they understand, but believe their total benefits outweigh the salary. The challenge with this line is my wife's insurance was less at 3 separate companies. Maternity\u002FPaternity Leave is far less generous (2 weeks for dads up from just 3 days 2 years ago for example compared to several months). You do not get days off like MLK Day, day after Thanksgiving, etc... that other companies have off and\u002For schools are closed meaning you have to dip into PTO to accommodate these days. \r\n\r\nJob titles in partner and product management make it hard to leave. Brand Managers and Senior Brand Managers should be called \""Partner Managers\"" because the responsibility is working with the assigned partner to grow the business. Brand Managers in other industries are responsible for the P&amp;L for their assigned lines inclusive of manufacturing, supply chain, promotions, etc... P&amp;L ownership does not occur until you reach Category Manager. Your job title responsibilities will not line up with other companies with similar titles decreasing your mobility to other companies and industries in the long term.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge is you can be blocked from moving to companies in the same industry. Moving to a manufacturer is possible, but approval is often required and more often than not is denied. While PPM leadership will say they have no problem with you leaving to a manufacturer (several have worked there themselves) when push comes to shove they make sure external opportunities are limited.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a career that is marketing focused, PPM is not the best department to be in. A large portion of the department are former sales people who transitioned over making it feel more like a sales organization than partner and product marketing. Marketing is a separate department and PPM roles are responsible for getting partners to invest more heavily in marketing. Marketing is pre-packaged and often leans more towards velocity products like laptops\u002Fmonitors instead of solutions based products that have longer sales cycles. Regardless of how effective the marketing is you are responsible for selling it to partners.\r\n\r\nAs CDW has grown the flexibility of PPM roles to influence their business has decreased. 2 years ago you had ability to invest funds however you wanted to grow the business within reason. Today all activities are heavily regulated and scrutinized making marketing and events very cookie-cutter.\r\n\r\nYour success in PPM greatly depends on your manager and department. The onboarding process for sales is highly structured, but PPM is hodge podge. With a good manager this can be overcome, otherwise you can easily get lost in the shuffle at the start.","1","CDW"

It's a good place to start a sales career for that reason.  That does have a downside, though (see cons).  \r\n\r\nCDW's health benefits are good.  BCBS medical and vision, CIGNA dental.  There's no fronting the cost for prescriptions and waiting for a refund.  All discounts are done up front.\r\n\r\nIt's a great place to get a first taste of technology sales. There are lots of entry level positions for recent college grads. For that reason, the average age of a coworker is pretty young.  \r\n\r\nSystems are very easy to master.  Creating quotes, finding product, and placing orders couldn't be simpler. The system does crash about once a week so be prepared for that.\r\n\r\nCDW holds a lot of contracts in the government space, which helps to open doors in that segment.\r\n\r\nHaving worked at CDW for a few years looks very good on a resume when applying to another sales job, whether in IT or not.","A new AM can expect the first year at CDW to be very difficult.  Unless you come from an IT background you won't know enough to be a real asset to your customers.  If you're on the government side, you pretty much have to wait until someone quits to get a decent account base. There simply aren't new government entities cropping up every day, unlike businesses.\r\n\r\nCDW has been around long enough to burn many IT professionals. For that reason, many will not want to do business with a new AM.  \r\n\r\nPay is pretty low compared to others in the industry.  The average small business AM makes $28k a year, so turnover there is high.  If you're in small business, get to med-lar within 2 years or quit.  The average med-lar rep makes $80k a year.  That's not bad, but if you were doing that volume anywhere else, you would be making much more.\r\n\r\nThe company is not flexible.  If you're an outside the box thinker or get frustrated with broken bureaucracy, you need not apply.  The same processes and systems that were broken when I started were still broken 5 years later.  \r\n\r\nCDW sells so much that it's really not great at anything.  It takes a few years, and many bruised relationships, to figure out what you can expect to actually deliver on.\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem at CDW by far is a lack of leadership at the tactical and operational level.  Managers are chosen based on diversity goals versus capability, and it shows.  I would give a new hire the following advice:  Do not expect your manager to coach or develop you in any way. Do not expect your manager to be able to muster any meaningful advice or resources to help you close business.  Do expect your manager to ask you what's in your pipeline.  Do expect your manager to lie to you.  If you get very good at the job and want to make a lateral or upward move, expect your manager to block you.

They pay all their sales staff at a base salary that is completely below a standard rate of living.  In a sales role this normally would not be bad. However, they have an awful commission structure, meaning you will never make any money.  They do not factor in what segment you are in.  So you get the same commission rate whether you are in small business or federal.  Unfortunately, unless you get a job in the federal segment, you will never make any money.  Even when hitting your goal, your commission checks are nothing and are usually never seen after taxes and benefits.  \r\n\r\nAfter the money situation, this has to be the most mis-managed and unprofessional environment.  During my employment with CDW, I had the most harassment and sexual harassment that I have ever seen in a work place.  I would get depressed thinking about having to go into work and wonder what type of harassment I would face that day.  I mentioned it to management on multiple occasions (over ten times in five months).  My manager's boss told her to address this to HR and she never did so.  She also told me that there was nothing that could be done.  Then I brought up to another boss, but he just participated in the behavior.  I was told every day that I should not be getting married due to my age and asked every day if I was pregnant (I am not).  People would come in hung over all day and spend their days trying to hook up with other co-workers.  They would talk about your body.  Nearly every day the office put the hard working, kind receptionist in tears for doing her job. \r\n\r\nWhen I finally quit and had the opportunity to share with HR the terrible experiences I had, they begged me to stay.  The day after I quit, the Director for my location and segment called me and asked me to come back.  This made me so angry.

The sales training was mediocre, but the technology training was very well done.  Get 18-24 months experience then get out.","The two biggest issues here are compensation and poor middle management.  For HiEd, K-12, Healthcare, S+L, and MedLar you are based at $25,000k.  This doesn’t change depending on seniority or performance.  Commission is 10% of GP unless you have about $40k in profit for the month.  At that point your base drops out and you get 16-21% depending on the total GP.  To put this in perspective here are some numbers of a typical AM who has been there for 2-4 years;  You sell $250,000 in a month at 8% GP netting $20,000 profit for the company and in $2,000 in commissions for you.  If you do that every month you will earn $24,000 in commission and $25,000 in base for $49,000\u002Fyear.  You aren’t poor by any means, but it is far below industry averages and around 30% of what they claim during the interview.  To top it off, if you fall behind 80% attainment of goal they don’t pay commission.  They try to hide this from new hires so if you are just starting ask about it.  Goals are often set a few days before the end of the month so this can be a surprise $2-3k hit. If it happens once or twice during busy season then you may quickly end up at $40,000 for the year instead of $50,000.\r\n\r\n\tManagement is made up primarily of people hired from 1998-2005.  In 2006 the company nearly doubled its sales staff so anyone with experience who wanted to be a manager got the job.  This resulted in a lot of under qualified and under motivated individuals in management.  To compound the issues, a lot of the people they started with are now on their teams.  This results in a favoritism that is toxic.  As people leave the company, their good accounts are given to the Managers friends, who then send their worst to the mid-level account managers, who take their worst and send them to the new employees.  This is a huge issue in government sales since new entities are rarely created meaning that hand downs are the only way to get new accounts.","0","CDW"

Get your act together! No structure may have worked 20 years ago when CDW was a small company but if they expect to succeed long term they need to put some resources into building a structure or fail. \r\n\r\nBig egos in middle to upper management - please leave your egos at the door. You're not that great. Sometimes I snicker inside or cringe in embarrassment at some of the self-appraising statements I hear. This group (middle to upper management) are way more unprofessional than other large companies I've worked for. It appears they try to hire women that fit the 'mold' however they tend to be high strung monsters to work for. Again, the egos at CDW tend to be out of control especially considering that no one in leadership I ever encountered attended above a tier 3 or 4 university. There is a lot of un-professionalism and nepotism in management which really kills the morale. The favoritism is rampant and to get ahead you better brown nose the right people and fit a certain mold.\r\n\r\nRevolving door in sales - VERY HIGH turnover. You never know when your 'coworker' or manager is just going to disappear one day. The company fires people for stupid reasons - usually it's political. They must have to pay a lot of unemployment compensation. Employees feel like there is an invisible hatchet over their neck - not a great way to promote good employee morale. In fact, it seems it's counterproductive. I have seen really good account managers start to fail when they're 'scolded' for inconsequential issues. \r\n\r\nStrategic big-picture thinking is not encouraged. Instead there is a lot of micromanaging and focus on unimportant details while missing the big picture completely. \r\n\r\nAn immature culture - lower\u002Fmiddle management does a lot of finger-pointing and blaming. Lots of nice, hardworking people have had to leave the company because a woman above them has control issues. Make sure when you promote a 'coworker' to be a people manager that the power over others doesn't go to their head. Also, start making them accountable for what goes on under them. A failing employee is usually due to a lack of clear direction and the ability to motivate and grow. Treating human beings the same way you'd treat your dog when they have an accident in the house is demeaning!!! I have also noticed a lot of condescending management styles and the use of humiliation to correct errors. Not a great way to get the best from your employees and it makes it very awkward for coworkers like me that cringe when we see this. Remember it's not just stressful for you and the person being 'scolded like a child' - it's very stressful for others around them. Be professional and take care of this stuff behind closed doors. Embarrassment and demeaning adults = bad management. Childish behavior from people in management should NOT be encouraged.  \r\n\r\nThe communications in this company are horrible! Not only do we rarely hear anything to explain company goals by the executives but when I have seen communications, I cringe at the grammatical errors and inability to articulate strategy clearly. Seriously the entire top tier of CDW needs some housecleaning!!! \r\n\r\nI really don't see this company succeeding long term.","0","CDW"

A difficult to use, poorly adopted CRM platform is the primary measuring stick. As a solutions architect, you're measured on your CRM contribution, you could be Elon Musk, but if CRM says you are crap, then you are crap, and you will feel crap.\n\n- It isn't very diverse (mostly white males).\n\n- You're consistently measured against well established product supply driven solutions practices such as hybrid infrastructure (big hardware BOM's for customers) and Workspace (big Office 365 sales, very basic integration on the back of desktop &amp; iPad sales etc). For someone that was meant to be innovating and iterating on a new line of tech, this was distracting, stressful, and over time it became depressing.\n\n- Solutions had already mothballed a number of other new tech incubations. If I had known this was due to the same issues I had faced, I would have turned down the opportunity to join.\n\n- The business as a whole is very vocal about promoting good mental health which is very encouraging but in practice it is very rarely followed. The solutions leadership teams will respond to e-mails late in the evening and in the early hours of the morning and promote stories of coworkers giving up their personal time to 'get this one over the line'.\n\n- Practice leads are toxic about other solutions teams and the architects within them. Team meetings include a significant amount of toxic humour, personally I couldn't wait to get that out of my system.\n\n- Nearly all of the most talented technologists have either left the company, moved out of solutions or are planning on leaving.\n\nGenerally speaking, I did get on very well with most of the other solutions architects (and sales in general). CDW is sales company, as long as you know that before joining you will probably enjoy it more than I did. If you go in there and try and get support on the adoption and sale of anything that doesn't related to product supply, then you're doomed to failure. If you are aligned to product supply, then you'll thrive.\n\nI am grateful for the experience but I would never go back.","0","CDW"

The reality is that in 6 years on the service desk (roughly 120 staff total at any one time), 3 people have actually been promoted to a higher position, there have been around 10 sideways promotions (people moving into newly created roles) but these are cut down roles so cannot be classed a genuine promotion.\r\n\r\nThere is no HR presence at all in the UK so if you have an issue\u002Fconcern then you can email Co Worker Services in the US or go to your team leader (who will literally ask you to email them and they will forward it to CO Worker Services in the US, no HR decision making is done in the UK). If you have for example a grievance with a staff member or professional concerns that you would take up with HR then you are out of luck here, there is literally no support for the staff. I have personally known of people who have raised issues (some really quite serious I might add) and they have just left the business without getting anywhere.\r\n\r\nMy advice would be that if you have no IT experience and no qualifications but would like to start a career in IT then join CDW, follow their advice and process calls the way the team leaders want, get 6 months under your belt and then go and work for literally any other company. If you are the kind of person that wants to ladder up without the knowledge or skills then just get yourself in the cliques that are obvious from the second you walk in and pat the right heads, you will be a team leader inside 4 months.

What a great organization.  Berbee had the values of \""we trust and support the individuals judgement.\""  CDW doesn't care.  They don't trust and support anyone anymore.  Alot of my clients loved Berbee and were happy with us most of them had never dealt with CDW and the ones that tried went somewhere else.  CDW raised prices and isn't even competitive.  But like everything after CDW took over cooperation, morale and quality have declined quickly.  Engineers who are happy do great work and create loyal customers.  CDW has killed that.  Engineers aren't happy.  Management is more interested in numbers and pushing people for maximum productivity.  If you aren't billing they aren't happy.  Management rarely meets with employees and if they do its counter productive, implementing new policies and procedures instead of leaving us alone to do our jobs.  Now they micromanage, demand constant updates, and tell engineers how, when and what they will do for a client.  Instead of letting engineers decide on the best path to conduct an install or resolve a problem or do an upgrade sales and management tell us what we are to do.  Sales seems to be driving the engineering force, best practices for the most part are ignored when dollars are questions.  Recommendations by engineers are ignored by sales if they can make more money. \r\n\r\nBenefits are gone.  They have the horrible benefits for an advanced technology company and they aren't even close to being competitive to others in this economy.  i suppose next year the consulting bonus will be gone.  Although its hard to make bonus now since they micromanage hours and if a project is undersold by sales they harp and ride you to keep hours down.  If you start to go over on hours they pressure you now to do unbillable work.  This way the sales numbers look good but the engineers loose their bonus.\r\n\r\nGrowth is a joke too.  At Berbee all engineers had the same title and ego's didn't get puffed up and very little in fighting occurred.  CDW implemented titles for engineers, senior engineers, architechs, etc.  Engineers with the bigger titles have let them go to their heads.  Cooperation and team work are out the window making this one of the most miserable places I have ever worked.  Senior engineers and architects talk down to others.

These 2 unicorns also get their hands dirty and learn the work we do instead of acting as if it's beneath them. Makes me feel like we're all in this together. I am given autonomy and support in my role and am never micromanaged. The work is challenging and interesting and I'm never bored. My teammates are great and we (and other department staff) collaborate often via Zoom or Teams so working from home gives me all the benefits of not commuting on Chicago's dicey public transportation (my nephew had to exit the train last week and have my sister pick him up when 4 thugs were harassing him) while sharing and receiving knowledge with others. I really don't think I could ever go back to working in an office after this excellent experience. The pay and benefits are great and I love that we get 2 days off Thanksgiving, Christmas &amp; New Years. We also get 8 hours paid time off Community Impact Time to volunteer for charities of our choice. The culture is diverse, inclusive and progressive in ways most corporations are not. I was floored when the CEO Sarah London stated her interest and intention to not indulge in luxuries people in her role often indulge in. This makes me feel she cares much more about making things right for the member and provider instead of money and prestige. It's nice working for a company than aligns with my values of altruism, hard work and a drive toward excellences without blaming and shaming and other toxic behaviors I've found at other companies. I've worked at places that only care about metrics and AR\u002Fmoney which burns the members as a result of shoddy work. This company lets me take the time to do excellent work which helps members\u002Fproviders and gives me a sense of satisfaction. I've always wanted a job working from home where people leave me alone and let me focus on my work while my bosses eliminate barriers and I have finally found it.","Nothing specific to this company, but Healthcare Revenue Cycle work is a LOT, regardless if you're working on the provider side or the payer side. There is a never-ending amount of work to do and it can be overwhelming. You will never finish and the best one can hope for is finding a realistic stopping point and try to prioritize your important tasks while not letting other work fall through the cracks. All managers are not as great as mine from what I hear. Like all corporate jobs, it's important not to burn yourself out and prioritize work\u002Flife balance.

Leadership at the company's headquarters is cartoonishly toxic, and this carries over to upper management at this location.

I have seen employees chastised to the point of tears, with one leader actually priding himself on having made certain people cry.\n\n2. While the company is ramping up efforts to improve internal systems, software, and processes, much of the system architecture leaves a lot to be desired. Work processes (i.e., the documents on which new hired are trained and all employees must consult) are poorly maintained, and updates or deployments pushed out to production platforms are seldom communicated to ground-level employees. As a result, many employees feel as though their work is constantly changing and that they are not being informed when changes are made.\n\n3. Virtually all of the work done here is reactive in nature. Again, as in con 2, the company is attempting to create work which is more proactive, such as process improvement initiatives. However, many ground-level employees feel that they are \""constantly putting out fires\"", which is another way of saying that the work they do is rarely productive and rarely fulfilling. While most of the employees have \""analyst\"" in their job title, reactive work does not require analytics and process improvement; instead, because of the time-sensitive nature of the situation, it requires quick, repetitive action. Also, work\u002Flife balance is this company has always been and continues to be a serious problem. If management feels that it is required, you will absolutely find yourself working both Saturday and Sunday, as well as extended hours during the weekdays.

Fine, but I wouldn't have left my old company if that had been the case. \r\n\r\nSecond, make sure you meet your manager. I did and I liked my manager well enough, but many of my coworkers didn't. They were told they'd be hired into one group and then that would change. I understand things do change and companies re-org (my department had more than one in my brief time there) but it's a sign that the company is still adapting, painfully, to change.\r\n\r\nThe single biggest problem I have with the company is its character. It is a Fortune 500 company that pays lip service to caring about its employees, yet everywhere I look I see people incredibly stressed-out and afraid. I've heard people say \""Oh, morale isn't low, we're just all focused.\"" I'd go to birthday celebrations and people would be so quiet, barely talking, just huddled in their little groups. People were AFRAID. There was definitely fear running through that company. The only ones who were happy there had either never worked anywhere else, or had worked at places with worse reputations like ExpressScripts.\r\n\r\nWorking at Centene's HQ feels like being in a police state. Security makes a point that employees are the biggest security risk, and you are treated as such. People are visibly uncomfortable when security gets on the elevator with them - it's like being followed by a squad car for more than half a mile on the highway. Parking is secured, building is secured, floors are secured and elevator access is secured. Everything you do is tracked. If you access the wrong website (say you pull up a page with \""SQL Injection\"") you'll get a phone call. If you miss a question on the ethics test you may get an email from HR. Every day I spent there felt suffocating. \r\n\r\nThere is a huge separation between the VPs and senior management, and everyone else. Abuse of power, and of employees, is frequent. I've seen analysts come out of meetings with senior management in tears over missed deadlines. I thought we were past this, people, and it is ridiculous to see bullying tolerated. When I complained (and I complained often) I was told \""oh, we're watching it, just keep focused on your work.\"" \r\n\r\nTechnology is surprisingly poor and the infrastructure controls make it difficult to get anything. When I signed on it took two weeks and no fewer than 20 distinct service requests to get all my applications and access points set up. \r\n\r\nThere is minimal work-life balance. When you start you don't get paid time off for 90 days. If you need to take off because you're sick, you're told just to come in. People would come in with bronchitis and walking pneumonia because they had run out of sick days. Terrible. If you miss hours one day you come in on the weekend to make them up. If you work extra one day, maybe you get to leave a little early the next but don't tell anyone. And there's absolutely no remote work - you'll get flagged if you try to do anything other than check email from home.","0","Centene"

Almost everything changed or had a catch to it... We have providers that are not being paid then providers that are being over paid (thousands of dollars) .claims denying and all the claims department can tell us is the system they use is denying them We can never get a clear answer to follow up with the people who are calling us (the call center front line) for answers. When I was hired (both times, through the agency and then through the company when I was converted)  i was hired for a customer service position , with out notice (and even while keeping my direct supervisor and manager in the dark) they decided they were going to move everyone from the customer service department to the program coordinator team and gave us just a few days notice that we would be starting training for the new position no questions asked .. just like everything else thus far it was poorly planned and poorly executed. We had one week of training and a couple of meetings and were thrown to the wolves...  The program coordinator team makes $2-$3 more than we did and we were promised an increase. But only the people who were with a temp agency on our team received an increase. The full time people did not receive an increase and for the past 3 months have been promised that it was going to be corrected we were going to receive back pay but no one has even discussed the pay with us even after reaching out several times to management.

Tricare is different then all other health insurance yet they have completely ignored that fact and run it into the ground. They love to hire people at the very top for Tricare that have ZERO healthcare experience let alone Tricare experience. They love to use outside consultants that have ZERO Tricare and possibly healthcare experience. They have jettisoned countless people that we actually need and replaced them (or not) with cheaper, less experienced and to be frank, not qualified people.

Everything, and I mean everything is wrapped in layer upon layer upon layer which creates constant confusion. The higher you climb the ladder, the more you will see just how inept at running a business this company is. That is a high level view but if you want to know about the little stuff- unless you are in California, your PTO will reset each year, pay not even close to being comparable to other companies, high cost for healthcare, ; dinosaur ideologies like no remote work ability, stringent dress code, and an utter lack of reward for hard work.

The cafeteria was great in downtown Clayton and there's a lot of name recognition when you have the company on your resume at least here in St. Louis.","Yeah, there's lots here.  It's a really toxic culture where burnout is very common and most of the time, you are forced to go over 40 hours most weeks which means you are working for free in those cases.  Work\u002FLife balance is non-existent here as I saw many people working 50 and even 60 hours a week and at least in our department, it was so hard to get people hired.  What I later found out was that HR is very slow posting jobs so departments poach employees from other departments which is unsustainable because eventually some department is going to the the odd one out and will have to post the position.  The Clayton office in particular is very stuffy and very conservative in dress (meaning you have to wear a tie).  Also politics runs rampant in the Clayton office so if you don't like that, stop applying and look elsewhere.  There were a lot of people I met that I wish I didn't meet because all they cared about was looking good and moving up and would use other people to make them look bad so that they could in turn look good.  Business is growing really fast here and I would say probably too fast because the systems and other processes as well as workers have not been able to sustainably adapt to the growth.  An example of this is the databases.  This is the only company where I've been sent in a queue where I've waited over an hour just to run a query.  Meanwhile, I'm just waiting and I'm not being a very productive employee since I need that query to finish so that I can do my job.  A big let down for me was when I gave my two weeks notice.  They did not explain the process at all and because of that, I lost my flexible spending account to where I can't access the money.  Also, they do not pay out on vacation upon leaving the company so I lost that too which is not good policy.  Every other company I've been at, I at least got some sort of vacation pay.  They also never gave me my exit interview or anything so I guess this is where they're going to get my feedback (albeit in public ).  As a side note too, they seem to have this bizarre cult like following of the CEO as his picture is on the home page every time you open it up and he's on every single training video where he adds absolutely no value to the video whatsoever.  One time they were pressuring employees to vote for him for some kind of executive of the year award.

They truly only care about compliance and not security which means they have a completely fractured security environment with various tools that do not receive proper care and feeding. This also means fractured security teams with defined roles being extremely vague... They also do not care much or at all to train their staff on the currently used security stack\u002Ftools. In other words, if you're an analyst, engineer or architect and are given a tool and need to be the SME DO NOT expect training. To be fair, maybe this is all because they've grown incredibly fast.\r\n\r\nAs to benefits it's nothing to droll over. I've had cheaper and better coverage at other companies. This I find strange as this is a HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANY! Their 401k is vested after 4 years and is matched to 3%. Not much to be desired honestly. They offer a 5% discount on purchasing stock... This is incredibly lame as most companies I'm familiar with is at least 15%. They do offer bonuses which seem decent, usually 6%. That said, if you are part of the company they acquire DO NOT expect a bonus when you get rolled into their HR fully.\r\n\r\nThe list can honestly go on and on IMO. Management infighting. A \""do as I say\"" not \""do as I do\"" type of management environment... Very condescending management across departments. I've seen managers and VP's come in and literally yell at individuals.","0","Centene"

I really appreciated the cafeteria, because they had a wide range of options. The workers were always nice and did a great job or washing my car and shampooing my seats. The other plus was the covered and free parking. Besides those few things, Centene is terrible.","Working at Centene is like being in an abusive relationship. I’ve never been in one but I would think it would be pretty close to working at this place. Centene is filled with bullies and unreal expectations and if you aren’t strong enough to interact with them you’ll fail. The management is awful. I can count on one hand the managers that are actually making a decision for the best interest of the members and can actually manage people and departments. Everyone else is trash. They are all condescending and nutty. None of them have any sense. It’s like working for toddlers.\n\nCentene is a prison. From the moment you set foot on Centene’s location, you have to have your ID or you will not be able to do basic things like get through main doors and use the elevators. Every door that you go through, minus the main front entrance, you have to swipe in. It’s like Fort Knox. If you forget your ID, you are treated like a child to get a replacement ID for the day. There isn’t any privacy. The cubes have glass around them so your department and neighbors can see every single thing that you are doing and hear every single conversation that you are having. In order to take or make a personal call, you need to leave your desk. There are so many people take personal calls in the kitchenette areas, stairwells, and cafeteria.\n\nThe WFH policy doesn’t exist. You may get away with it for extreme emergencies, but it’s very much so looked down upon. Centene is not flexible with hours, they are a hard 8-5 type of company. If you want flexibility, you have to take it upon yourself to do so until someone says anything.\n\nThe stress level at Centene has caused issues within peoples family because they either never get a break (always on call) or it causes issues with your health. So many people within my department have had health issues because of the stress from Centene (myself included). I knew within the first two months of working there that Centene was not the place for normal people. Everyone that I met at the beginning of working at Centene (2 years ago) have left. I know very few people that have stayed at Centene past 2-3 years. I know a few people that have taken a leave of absence so that they can find a new job, because it was too stressful. \n\nI have never felt so dumb at any place I’ve ever worked. Centene spends a lot of money to outsource everything. Our department was never able to use our brains there. Everyone in my department was treated as an admin. Not that there is anything wrong with an admin, but when you are hired to do something else besides what you were told your job duties were. Your morale shifts and you start to wonder why are you even there. I’ve missed out on 2 years of career development. Centene has held me back on advancing my career and I couldn’t get it fast enough.\n\nThankfully, I am no longer at the hell hole. Within the last two months, 4 people have left my department. The rest of the department is looking. I made sure to tear that place into pieces within my exit survey and interview. My department had terrible engagement scores and nothing was ever done about it even HR got involved. Centene does not care about their employees well-being. They only want to continue being in the spotlight and making more people at the top more money. So they will continue to hire and not have processed in order, and they will eventually crumble. The turnover is too high. I surely hope I’m around when they do crumble. I have NEVER in my life worked in a place so toxic and unethical in all of my life. So if you don’t care about your health, love being overworked, enjoy being bullied, like being watched and treated like a child, (if you have a family) enjoys missing time with your family....then this place is for YOU. If you have morals and other options...RUN...RUN VERY FAST. NEVER EVER LOOK BACK!! I promise you. I wish someone would have told me all of this. Save yourself the trouble.","0","Centene"

Or if you are familiar with the show, Stranger Things, it’s like being trapped in the Upside Down. My coworkers and I would joke that any minute Ashton Kutcher was going to jump out from a corner and tell us that we’ve been punked. It’s, by far, the most dysfunctional and dreadful place I have ever worked. \r\n\r\nCentene’s biggest issue is management\u002Fleadership. Ninety-five percent of management is completely inept. It’s true of the entire company; not just the department I was in. The majority of management is grossly under qualified for their positions, have no management skills, bully their employees, thrive on gossip, and are disrespectful to basically anyone they encounter. I don’t see the cycle of bad management ending anytime soon. Current management does not promote smart, capable people to management positions. Instead, they either hire someone from the outside who has zero experience in the healthcare industry or they promote someone from within who doesn’t qualify, can’t do the job, and\u002For has been a poor performer. My guess is that they do this because they are either too dumb to know better or they don’t want any competition at the top.\r\n\r\nRampant poor management leads to other issues like a toxic culture, low morale, and overall employee dissatisfaction. You are not viewed as a human being once you step foot in the door. You’re expected to work an obscene amount of overtime. Every day is spent putting out fires that are lit by management’s inability to do its job. Also, every person is expected to do the work of 3-4 people. So forget work\u002Flife balance. Company policy is no work from home and no remote employees. You’ll see exceptions being made here and there, but don’t expect it if you are a hard worker. The exceptions are usually made for those with poor performance. It made no sense. Oh, and while you are working your life away your manager will likely be shopping online or kicked back with his\u002Fher feet up on the desk browsing through social media on their phone. \r\n\r\nDon’t expect any help from HR. They have no power…or balls. They are there to cover and protect management. Complaints in my dept were repeatedly made to HR and nothing was ever done. They just talk in circles like they are doing something, but they aren’t. Every year they send out an employee satisfaction survey, and every year they act like the results came back just fine and refuse to take action on anything. I questioned a VP in my dept about HR's lack of action on the survey results. He literally told me the company, as a whole, has no plans to do anything about it. As long as the company is climbing the Fortune 500 list they don’t care about anything else. You may see articles in the news about how much Centene is growing and all the new jobs they are hiring for. Don’t let them fool you. Sure, it’s growing (for the moment) but the current workforce is flying out the doors as quickly as it can. It does not take long for a new employee to figure out there is something seriously wrong with that place. Most of their hiring is just to refill positions that left. \r\n\r\nSecurity there is over-the-top. Cameras and security guards are everywhere. You have to swipe your badge so many places just to get in and out. I had to swipe my badge 9 times just to get to my desk every morning. Sure, you do feel safe that nothing too crazy will happen there, but I would still feel safe with much less security. You feel like you are in a police state. Some individual guards were very nice but, like the rest of the management, the management in security are bullies. I know several coworkers who got a 3-4 page scathing email from security just for parking in the wrong spot! It’s insane.\r\n\r\nI could go on and on, but I think you get the picture. You have been warned. It's worth being unemployed a little longer to find a company that is not ran by ignorant lunatics.","0","Centene"

Don't try to get answers directly (even on basic simple things) from anyone above you.  You have to ask your manager to get answers from other managers or specialty department leaders, and if you need an answer from 2 levels up, it must go through multiple management levels.  Because the company has grown so quickly, most of the leaders are in over their heads, but won't admit it. The fear of not getting things done when dictated from the top makes for poor short-term decisions to meet unlofty goals that create much long-term chaos. The company is siloed and trying to get information as a new employee is very difficult.  No one responds and when they do it is usually with wrong or incomplete information or they refer you to someone else who doesn't respond or refers you to another source, it never ends.  Forget about work life balance, comfortable work environment, flexible schedules or telecommuting of any kind.

I’ve witnessed  managers cutting off reports during meetings, belittling them, and treating their reports terribly. There needs to be more diversity in management-race, age, sex, thought process- than there is. Perhaps require more management training for managers. Give employees MORE opportunities to give anonymous feedback on their manager’s performance AND take action. There is so much dysfunction in management it’s no wonder this company is rated so terribly by employees.\n-Micromanagement to the max. Seriously, it’s common knowledge at this point (2018) micromanaging has a negative effect on productivity and morale. Insecure managers need to go or be let go. Centene management still figuring this out unfortunately.\n-Security run amuck. Major imbalance between security and productivity. Security needs to be reigned in and counterbalanced with functionality and usability. Systems are locked down to the point that you can’t even make simple adjustments to settings on your laptop. At corporate, you have to swipe your badge half a dozen times just to get to your desk. It’s a joke.\n-No maternity leave policy. Sorry, young families. You’re on your own.\n-Cube walls at corporate office are glass. The environment is so disruptive and distracting. Who thought this was a good idea? No sense of privacy whatsoever. Newsflash- Open office environments make some employees miserable and have a negative impact on productivity. \n-No work from home policy. Seriously, it’s almost 2019. That needs to change.\n-Men at corporate required to wear ties. Again, that place is so backwards that appearances are favored over substance. Managers scheduling meetings every other day to follow up (micromanage) a project- again, only appearing to be useful. Start measuring performance based on what’s actually produced rather than superficialities, and allow your team to succeed by giving them more autonomy.","0","Centene"

They need to hire more base reps and less vendors or they will keep losing base reps.\nConstant extensions, although they have gotten better with some being voluntary.\nNot great work\u002Flife balance if a raindrop falls somewhere.\nThey expect you to be a robot.","1","Duke Energy"

Time management is not an actual concept you can ever embrace here due to how inefficient both the company and clients are as a whole but learning to prioritize will save your sanity. You quickly learn that project efficiency and cost-effectiveness + long term reliability and safety are the ways to go, not bending over for the crying client who thinks touting that they've \""put up with Duke for over 30 years\"" and \""I've never had to provide this in my life for these projects until now\"" are going to do anything for them. Management sees that in reverse order though, as you will continuously find out in your simulated prison sentence masquerading as the Distribution engineering department.","You can pretty much sum up any and all cons for this place as the \""typical Dilbert comic style outdated corporate environment\"" but let us explore some pain points below. You'll also notice I don't use the word \""customer\"" here, because working in this company has made me cringe at that phrase. At Duke, you're just another number. \r\n\r\n- Lack of communication and cooperation between departments, treating every department as an individual \""silo\"" and people wonder why things don't get done. I learned one of my favorite phrases in this job that I'll say in a different way here: Too many coaches, not enough players. Too many cooks spoil the broth. You get the picture, everyone has their useless input in the email chain when something goes wrong but nobody wants to take action and accept responsibility. So they dump the problem on engineering! Leads into the next con...\r\n\r\n- Lack of initiative and responsibility on most everyone outside of engineering. Facing a difficult client that asks a tough question such as \""when will the service to the house get turned on\""? Dump it over to engineering. Found a broken wooden pole in the field that should've been fixed by the linemen instead of sending it somewhere else for a work order to be made up? Send to engineering. Physical material not show up for the job or is incorrect despite the list of materials showing what should actually be there? No, don't contact corporate trucking or supply chain. Instead, contact engineering, who has an even smaller amount of control than the person contacting them about the problem. Engineering is the Dumping Ground for when you have a problem you do not want to deal with, and you frequently turn into just being a middle-man for calling people.\r\n\r\n- Everyone (inside and outside the organization!) thinks engineering has much more control over the full project than they actually do. No, engineering does not schedule the work. No, engineering does not pick the material from the yard and bring it to the site or load it onto the material handler trucks. No, engineering does not have an estimated time the linemen will get there to start work, nor do they supervise the linemen and know the schedule. No, engineering does not exactly know where anything is buried. The scope of the engineering department is much more limited than everyone thinks, which is perfectly fine were it not for the company's obsession with their twisted definition of \""customer service\"" claiming the poor sap in the engineering department owns the project\u002Fwork order from start to finish. This is both a detriment to dealing with internal parties as well as the outside clients in which the work originally stems from. \r\n\r\n- Continuing from the last point, the bold claim that engineering \""OWNS\"" the work order\u002Fproject from the company's favorite quote \""cradle to grave\"". Not the best idea, having one person both directly interfacing with the outside clients 24\u002F7 AND doing the actual behind the scenes work to get the project going on the utility side. Between lack of actual control over the scheduling\u002Fconstruction, funky software, babysitting the needy\u002Fgreedy clients and more, you'll be amazed you can get any actual work done. You either can POSSIBLY catch up on emails and missed calls for the day, or get actual work done and scheduled (scheduled by someone else, do not forget). Never both, but don't tell management that cause they won't be able to hear you tucked away behind closed doors in their private offices. Engineering; even with all of the quirky software they have to use, would operate much more smoothly if they stuck to being fully behind the scenes instead of being one step up from call center representatives. Those sad, sad people. \r\n\r\n- Changing gears for a bit, the lack of a centralized employee handbook. Never given one at the beginning of the job, because I'm pretty sure one centralized document does not exist. Ever want to know the vacation policy? Better go give it a search on the company portal page, pray that you find it and hope that whatever document comes up is not out of date. Curious about maternity leave policy or any other common policy that's usually contained in one large handbook for all employees upon starting the job? Give it a go on the company's portal page and hope you can find something. Can't find it there? Ask one of the older coworkers, who may or may not know and if they do know... they don't remember where from. A lot of knowledge about anything and everything related to the job comes from word of mouth, which is terribly inconvenient because a lot of policies and standards change quite a bit through the years. Good luck knowing that though, from the slew of spam emails sent directly by the company to your inbox. No, I don't want to listen to a \""fireside chat\"" by the rich out-of-touch CEO, I want to know if the permanent above-ground pedestals we used are still within standards or if the amount of conductors in those pedestals has changed because I heard that through word of mouth from 3 different people. \r\n\r\n-Implementation of policies and processes with no input from the people in the field. By the time you learn what to do to get the job done right for once, the process and standards have already changed. This is by far one of the lesser gripes because thankfully everyone feels the pain, and it becomes comedic when it's a policy\u002Fprocess change related to anything the client has to deal with or provide. A change like finally having one dedicated email address for clients to send subdivision\u002Fapartment infrastructure paperwork to or requiring more responsibility on the client side related to temporary services always means the clients throw a fit, and then engineering gets the backlash for it despite engineering not having anything to do with the change. Excuse me, I mean the part of engineering that does the actual projects\u002Fwork orders. The Standards group and management\u002FHR jockeys that implement these changes don't have to endure the pain of dealing with the general public, so they are consequence free to do whatever they wish. \r\n\r\n-Implementation of a work management system that solely benefits accounting and is a complete obstacle to engineering and construction\u002Fmaintenance. Ever wonder why all those old rotten poles are sitting out there that Duke more than likely knows about? \""The Budget\"". Why are whole stretches of power lines not properly maintained or replaced? \""The Budget\"". Line upgrade projects needed due to projected future load on standby? Oh, we can't get to it until at least next year because of \""The Budget\"". The mythical Budget that nobody in the office fully understands or knows numbers of, The Budget that management claims to base their decisions off of, this is the Budget everyone speaks of yet knows nothing of. It sure affects everything though. With how much year after year management tells you the \""Budget\"" governs which projects go forward and which ones don't, it is mildly interesting to see how little they actually care about preserving \""The Budget\"" if there's even a 1% chance a meter is going to be set somewhere. Duke seems to rarely have \""The Budget\"" to replace leaning and rotten poles in neighborhoods that are obvious safety hazards, yet will be glad to install 100s of thousands dollars worth of infrastructure in a \""possible\"" future subdivision in which no guarantee any homes will be built. It isn't a shock to go to anywhere within the Duke territory and see entire plots of land with their infrastructure on it, but doesn't actually feed anything. You'd think such a budget-conscious company would do their due diligence to make sure the time and money spent on installing this equipment would bear fruit, but you'd be wrong. I am highly inclined to believe the secret top reason stuff gets put in whether it gets used or not is to shut the clients up and reduce the chance that they'll figure out a manager's number to call them up. \r\n\r\n- Extreme focus on \""CUSTOMER SERVICE\"", which is cute coming from a company that is a near monopoly and has little need to put such emphasis on it. Also doesn't help that the company is generally disliked by the general public, and you start seeing a recipe for success here. You know what actually pleases people? Projects that are complete and infrastructure that is put in doing what it needs to do, not babysitting the clients who call in all the time and never give you the information you need to get the work done that benefits THEM. Like I was hinting at before, having engineering do the actual work AND bending over pleasing these people is not a good combination. Duke tries to set up their system as if they are the friendly neighborhood utility that will cater to your every need, but with how their processes are set up and (mostly) monopolized they are the \""customer focus\"" portion is just delegated to the poor untrained and underpaid saps in the call center and the sad individuals stuck in engineering who have to deal with these people. You can also include the linemen who are unfortunately stuck with dealing with these individuals come construction time, and corporate trucking who half the time is forced to deliver to a site that is probably still unpaved and where the site people always expect them to be there yesterday. Management will always tout \""customer service\"" to everyone under their umbrella, only because they don't have to directly deal with the external parties themselves. That is, until the external clients come crying in because the company isn't bending over for them as much as they did 20 years ago like the clients claim and get phone numbers in management. That's when management starts breathing down YOUR neck, so make sure you have yourself covered which leads to the next point...\r\n\r\n- No matter how well you do with your work or how timely everything is scheduled, always save your emails with external clients (I suppose everyone internal too) because it will never be enough and throughout your tenure external clients will always try to somehow screw you over and complain to management. Cover yourself first, because management always takes the client's side until you can prove yourself correct in a Guilty unless proven Innocent mentality. Even if you have all your t's crossed and i's dotted, they'll always find some way to lecture you on how \""you could've done better\"" and gone unnecessarily above and beyond for these clients who will never for a minute provide you with everything you need to get your job done. Which I'll remind you, is to help ensure infrastructure gets installed due to the load they are adding. You give them an inch, they want a mile, and it never ends. Always cover yourself, because external clients never seemingly get enough and management always takes the \""customer is always right\"" approach. Better to get the job done and out of the way, because ultimately the meter being set is the only thing anyone is really after. That gives me a thought, on another con...\r\n\r\n- Due to the extreme and often unnecessary demand of the external clients (perpetually acting like you are ruining their lives if you don't get meters set and infrastructure installed yesterday that takes weeks) loads of work gets rushed on the Duke side and what actually gets installed for a project is quite possibly never the best solution. This reason is a good chance why some infrastructure that is installed out there looks pretty funky and is seemingly unreliable come storm time, especially the older infrastructure. It is likely \""rushed\"" and designed\u002Finstalled the quickest and bare minimum meets standards as possible so ultimately the engineering department can lessen their over-the-top workload and get these clients off their backs. Because like mentioned before, Duke expects the poor engineering person assigned to the project to own it \""cradle to grave\"" and provides little to no support for them unless the clients call in to raise a fuss (usually for little to no reason) in which case management steps in to shut them up and facilitate the project to be rushed. Not many systems or processes in place to be proactive in mitigating these problems, only being reactive to the problems happening. Hence, why a lot of work gets rushed and people scramble to get things done. Speaking of storms from before...\r\n\r\n- Never be under the illusion that you will catch up on your work, because 1.grossly understaffed\r\n2.clients that will forever make your job miserable and actively fight against you to provide information you need, which again the reminder is that this is info you need to get the projects done that THEY initiate\r\n3.clients will never get the site ready for utility construction, even if you beat the requirements into their heads multiple times. Doesn't matter that they've done these same projects over the course of decades with Duke, they apparently have memory loss at the end of every project and forget what you need to get things done\r\n4. STORMS. Get ready for the other part of the job, which is completely different from your regular job duties. Let's save that for a different point below because it is it's own can of worms.\r\n\r\n- Storms. Be prepared to drop everything you are doing to perform damage assessment if so much as a gust of wind rolls through town and downs a service line to a house at the edge of the territory. With hurricane season regularly coming and going, be prepared to go scouting for damage from dawn to dusk (sometimes after dark, because looking for downed power lines that blend in with the dark is smart!) because the company is \""committed\"" to \""customer service\"" and safety. The longer the lines remain de-energized, the more money they lose and the more riled up the general public becomes. Be prepared to deal with the general public running in front of your vehicle, trying to flag you down from the side of the road, personal vehicles blocking your exits, etc. because people want to know when the lights are coming back on and the call center number they called provides no info OR JUST AS LIKELY provides false info as to when the lines will be fixed. Alludes to something said previously, engineering does not ever know when any of these is ever happening. They're just sent out to assess damage, and record the details so the linemen can eventually get out there to fix what needs to be fixed. Nothing more, nothing less. All of this means your regular work gets put on hold, and guess what? General public\u002Fexternal clients doesn't care about that, Tropical Storm Duke just rolled through their neighborhood and you'll get calls as if no storm is going on and why the infrastructure they called for hasn't been installed yet even if their entire site is a giant wet puddle. Only benefit here is you get to use this time as an excuse to set your voicemails\u002Fautomatic email replies saying \""storm rolled through, restoring those lines are priority not your apartment complex that isn't getting built for two years\"". Certainly doesn't stop your regular work from coming in though, and it is mentally draining performing this damage assessment. Not even going to go into the strange pay structure Duke has set up for this part of the job which leads to contention between engineering and the linemen. You may get a free dinner out of it though, but I feel by that time of the day I just want to be home and away from everyone else who is just as disgruntled. \r\n\r\n- Strange software. Definitely one of the smallest gripes with the job; at first, it seems like one of the bigger problems but once you firmly grasp the above cons you realize it's extremely minor. Constant crashes, freezes, strange processes from start to finish, performing certain actions with designing or progressing the work order\u002Fproject that may seem illogical, \""clicking too fast\"", and more certainly becomes a minor inconvenience. You better believe it contributes to a slower lifecycle of a project on the Duke side though. You learn to laugh at how hilariously inefficient the software is, especially when life around you is seemingly in flames and you're constantly backed into a corner. Funny enough, the software dedicated to storm outage restoration is robust and mostly reliable; likely due to how barebones and minimal it is. I believe that is best and is probably one of the few pros of the job. \r\n\r\n- Another glassdoor user noted lack of experienced peers due to them seeking jobs outside of engineering because of constant addition of responsibility to the job with a lack of benefit to go with it... I agree and disagree with this. Everyone that is intelligent makes sure to leave as quickly as they can for greener pastures, or gets lucky and figures out how to transfer to a much better job in a much better department. Everyone that wishes to become the ideal company drone finds out who to suck up to, and goes that route. For everyone else that is certainly smart and capable but has lots of outside family\u002Flife obligations or is unlucky, they are unfortunately stuck where they're at. So I disagree with that there is a lack of experienced peers. There are plenty of the old-timers to go around with their collective wisdom and experience... along with their common health issues, and general sense of depression in the workplace. You will never find a group more ready for retirement or a severance package than people in Distribution. \r\n\r\n- Good luck working in a smaller office that isn't Charlotte or Raleigh and transferring to a different role\u002Fdepartment without suffering for 5+ years in your current role, because it likely won't happen. Unless you are an expert at kissing up to the right people, you're essentially pigeon-holed in your current job and stuck there. It's difficult to even transfer to THE SAME ROLE you are already performing but at a different location, and good luck finding out the real reason as to why your interview was unsuccessful. Claiming \""the other candidate had more experience\"" only works for so long especially if you're applying to the same role you currently hold but at a different location. That tells me that others in the same job are suffering as well, and trying in vain to go to other locations for even a .5% chance at landing a different role later down the line. Would rather not waste years of my life down the drain to constantly be beaten down and demoralized week after week. It seems to be the type of workplace where you can only get a better role by knowing the right person, being in a city location like Charlotte and being nurtured along a career path through there, or come in from an outside organization to get paid more for less work. Speaking of...\r\n\r\n- Don't think career development is really a thing here, especially if you are working outside of Charlotte or Raleigh. Pigeon-hole is the best way I can put whatever role you're in if you're at a smaller office. At least, nothing formal seems to be set up. If it's out there, it's somewhere to be searched in vain on the company portal along with the single collective employee handbook that probably doesn't exist and Sasquatch lurking somewhere on the 3rd search page. \r\n\r\n- HR? HR who? Pretty sure they were outsourced, and never think for a moment they are there to help you. No, they're to protect the company from the employees and be as vague as possible. That is, if you even know who HR is. \r\n\r\nThere is a lot more, but enough has been said here. To sum it up; stay away from engineering on the distribution side, you will regret it immensely. Save your sanity and walk away. You can get better pay elsewhere, you can get better life fulfillment elsewhere. You will forever be plagued by bad memories and experiences after you see any power lines afterwards.","0","Duke Energy"

The Obama administration planned on winding Fannie down with a plan of bringing the capital position to zero by Jan. 2018. Not only is Fannie still in place, it's delivering billions of dollars to Treasure each year. Those dollars are generated from gaurantee fees collected on qualifying mortgages to cover losses related to loan defaults: essentially insurance. But all of the money collected in fees is transferred quarterly to the US Treasury, so there'll no capital to cover related losses. As a result, Fannie Mae would need to draw from Treasury to cover quarterly losses. This is exacerbated by a lower than 35% Corporate Tax rate. Fannie Mae is still writing off losses, but the writeoffs assumed a 35% tax rate. A rate any lower decreases the value of the write-offs, which increases Fannie's tax liability.

My nick name for Fannie Mae is \""Stepford\"" after the famous original movie and remake.  Everyone walks around there with a fake \""installed\"" smile on their face.  They will drink the Kool-Aid or they will be gone!  I was pulled over by my boss in the hallway for coughing on a conference call.  If you have seen the original or remake of the movie \""Stepford Wives\"" you will get the idea.  My professional IT career stretches 37 years and I've worked for many different organizations during that time.  Never have I worked for an organization more concerned about the slightest “real” emotion emoted.  No expressed frustration allowed, no expressed anger allowed.  OK, I can hear you, this is someone with no social skills or someone who doesn’t know how to behave at work.  NO, I can assure you I’m not some crazy overly emotional person who runs up and down the hallways screaming that the sky is falling or acting like my hair is on fire. I’m a real person, and real people occasionally get frustrated and angry.\r\nI transferred to my 2nd of two positions during my stint at Fannie a year before I was “laid off”.  I had 4 managers during that 1 year period of time.  What you see on Glassdoor reviews about re-orgs is absolutely true ─ very frequent.  They also execute lay-offs about once a quarter.  Maybe not unlike some organizations, but hopefully unlike most organizations, they use this lay off cycle to get rid of people they don’t like and don’t want to be bothered with going through formal HR steps that are required “in writing” by the organization to work with the employee to guide the performance of the employee to be more in line with their position or with the desires of their manager.\r\nI was told by a colleague that my boss told said colleague that he thought I was a horrible PM (20+yrs experience) and that he planned to “manage me out”, i.e. make me so miserable I would “self-migrate” .  My bosses actions had already started to mimic that kind of behavior.  He was visibly, with malice of foresight, getting in the way of me doing the job I was hired to do.  After 37+ yrs as a professional,  it’s not like I’ve never seen this behavior before, but it had never been directed at me personally.  If you’ve never had this happen to you, well, great for you!  If so, I feel your pain.\r\nThis behavior stopped at some point after I confronted my manager, but the giant had just gone to sleep.  Next lay off, yep, I was gone.  Three days later, my old job was posted on the job boards.  Never a single word was said to me by my boss that there was a single issue with my performance or any guidance to modify my behavior or deliver anything more or differently than the status quo. \r\nWith the exception of my boss, and the director who must’ve been complicit, I loved the work I did at Fannie Mae.  I was a “one stop shop” POC for the service my team provided.  I received multiple service awards and multiple glowing emails from customers who were extremely pleased with the service I provided.  I believe the issue was that I wasn’t subservient enough for my authoritarian boss who went to military boys school and has no college education what so ever.","0","Fannie Mae"
